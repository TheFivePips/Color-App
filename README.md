This is a larger code along project from Colt steele that practices using React. It will use both functional and class componenets and a mixed use of hooks as it is intended to be a practice project.

It will also use MaterialUI, chroma, emoji-mart, react-copy-to-clipboard, react-sortable-hoc, react form validator.

This project has used some updated technologies since it was released. Jss is depreciated and so Sass was used in its place, As well as react-router v4 being repalced by v6. It will also replace react-color with react-colorful to be compatibale with funtcional hooks. react-sortable-hoc is no longer supported but it is the best library I have found for 2d grid dnd.

I have decided to make some changes to the general layout, in a way that makes more sense to me. It does not effect any of the functionality, but will not be identical to the offical final project.

I might replace the sass files with styled componenets since that is more inline with the original intent.
I could also probably improve the app by using context to increase readability and share global state across multiple componenets. That may come later
