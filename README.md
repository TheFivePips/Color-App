This is a larger code along project from Colt steele that practices using React and CSS. It will use both functional and class componenets and a mixed use of hooks as it is intended to be a practice project

It will also use MaterialUI, chroma, emoji-mart, react-copy-to-clipboard, react-sortable-hoc, react form validator

This project has used some updated technologies since it was released. Jss is depreciated and so Sass was used in its place, As well as react-router v4 being repalced by v6. It will also replace react-color with react-colorful to be compatibale with funtcional hooks. react-sortable-hoc is no longer supported but it is the best library I have found for 2d grid dnd.


I might replace the sass files with styled componenets since that is more inline with the original intent
